  abstract: We define a generalization of Massey products for algebras over a Koszul
    operad in characteristic zero, extending Massey's and Allday's and Retah's in
    the associative and Lie cases, respectively. We establish connections with minimal

- abstract: We prove that the (homotopy) hypercommutative algebra structure on the
    de Rham cohomology of a Poisson or Jacobi manifold defined by several authors
    is (homotopically) trivial, i.e. it reduces to the underlying (homotopy) commutative
    algebra structure. We do so by showing that the DG operads which codify the algebraic
    structure on the de Rham complex of Poisson and Jacobi manifolds, generated by
    the exterior product and the interior products with the structure polyvector fields,
    are quasi-isomorphic to the commutative suboperad. Hence, there is no hope to
    endow the de Rham cohomology of such manifolds with any (higher) structure beyond
    the well-known (homotopy) commutative algebra structure, which exists for any
    smooth manifold. We proceed similarly with the commutative Batalin-Vilkovisky-infinity
    algebra structure on the de Rham complex of a generalized Poisson supermanifold.

  title: Enhanced finite triangulated categories
  type: article-journal
  volume: '21'
  zbmath_url: https://zbmath.org/7506910
- abstract: We work over a perfect field. Recent work of the third-named author established
    a Derived Auslander Correspondence that relates finite-dimensional self-injective
    algebras that are twisted $3$-periodic to algebraic triangulated categories of
    finite type. Moreover, the aforementioned work also shows that the latter triangulated
    categories admit a unique differential graded enhancement. In this article we
    prove a higher-dimensional version of this result that, given an integer $d\geq1$,
    relates twisted $(d+2)$-periodic algebras to algebraic triangulated categories
    with a $d\mathbb{Z}$-cluster tilting object. We also show that the latter triangulated
    categories admit a unique differential graded enhancement. Our result yields recognition
    theorems for interesting algebraic triangulated categories, such as the Amiot
    cluster category of a self-injective quiver with potential in the sense of Herschend
    and Iyama and, more generally, the Amiot-Guo-Keller cluster category associated
    with a $d$-representation finite algebra in the sense of Iyama and Oppermann.
    As an application of our result, we obtain infinitely many triangulated categories
    with a unique differential graded enhancement that is not strongly unique. In
    the appendix, B. Keller explains how -- combined with crucial results of August
    and Hua-Keller -- our main result yields the last key ingredient to prove the
    Donovan-Wemyss Conjecture in the context of the Homological Minimal Model Program
    for threefolds.

    with Waldhausen $K$-theory in the case where the derivator arises from a good
    Waldhausen category. This $K$-theory is not invariant under general equivalences
    of derivators, but only under a stronger notion of equivalence that is defined
    by considering a simplicial enrichment of the category of derivators. We show
    that derivator $K$-theory, as originally defined, is the best approximation to
    Waldhausen $K$-theory by a functor that is invariant under equivalences of derivators.

  abstract: We construct small cylinders for cellular non-symmetric DG-operads over
    an arbitrary commutative ring by using the basic perturbation lemma from homological
    algebra. We show that our construction, applied to the A-infinity operad, yields
    the operad parametrizing A-infinity maps whose linear part is the identity. We
    also compute some other examples with non-trivial operations in arities 1 and
    0.

  abstract: 'In a well generated triangulated category T, given a regular cardinal
    a, we consider the following problems: given a functor from the category of a-compact
    objects to abelian groups that preserves products of <a objects and takes exact
    triangles to exact sequences, is it the restriction of a representable functor
    in T? Is every natural transformation between two such restricted representable
    functors induced by a map between the representatives? If the answer to both questions
    is positive we say that T satisfies a-Adams representability. A classical result
    going back to Brown and Adams shows that the stable homotopy category satisfies
    Adams representability for the first infinite cardinal. For that cardinal, Adams
    representability is well understood thanks to the work of Christensen, Keller
    and Neeman. In this paper, we develop an obstruction theory to decide when T satisfies
    a-Adams representability. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions of homological
    nature, and we compute several examples. In particular, we show that there are
    rings satisfying a-Adams representability for all non-countable cardinals a and
    rings which do not satisfy a-Adams representability for any infinite cardinal
    a. Moreover, we exhibit rings for which the answer to both questions is no for
    infinite many cardinals. As a side result, we give an example of an infinite phantom
    map.'

  abstract: In this paper we introduce a new approach to determinant functors which
    allows us to extend Deligne's determinant functors for exact categories to Waldhausen
    categories, (strongly) triangulated categories, and derivators. We construct universal
    determinant functors in all cases by original methods which are interesting even
    for the known cases. Moreover, we show that the target of each universal determinant
    functor computes the corresponding $K$-theory in dimensions 0 and 1. As applications,
    we answer open questions by Maltsiniotis and Neeman on the $K$-theory of (strongly)
    triangulated categories and a question of Grothendieck to Knudsen on determinant
    functors. We also prove additivity theorems for low-dimensional $K$-theory and
    obtain generators and (some) relations for various $K_{1}$-groups.

  abstract: In this paper we study spaces of algebras over an operad (non-symmetric)
    in symmetric monoidal model categories. We first compute the homotopy fiber of
    the forgetful functor sending an algebra to its underlying object, extending a
    result of Rezk. We then apply this computation to the construction of geometric
    moduli stacks of algebras over an operad in a homotopical algebraic geometry context
    in the sense of To\"en and Vezzosi. We show under mild hypotheses that the moduli
    stack of unital associative algebras is a Zariski open substack of the moduli
    stack of non-necessarily unital associative algebras. The classical analogue for
    finite-dimensional vector spaces was noticed by Gabriel.

- abstract: "This is the final version of a series of papers uploaded in May 25, 2005.\
    \ We have splitted the long last paper of the previous version in two parts to\
    \ make it easier to understand. The results are essentially the same, although\
    \ the presentation has changed substantially. The first three papers have not\
    \ changed.\n  This is a collection of five papers on the foundation of triangulated\
    \ categories in the context of groupoid-enriched categories, termed track categories,\
    \ and characteristic cohomology classes. As a main result it is shown that given\
    \ an additive category A with a translation functor t: A --> A and a class V in\
    \ translation cohomology H^3(A,t) then two simple properties of V imply that (A,t)\
    \ is a triangulated category. The cohomology class V yields an equivalence class\
    \ (B,[s]) where B is a track category with homotopy category A and [s] is the\
    \ homotopy class of a pseudofunctor s: B --> B inducing t. The two properties\
    \ of V correspond to natural axioms on B and s which again imply that (A,t) is\
    \ a triangulated category.\n  The five papers of this volume depend on each other\
    \ by cross references, but each paper can be read independently of the others\
    \ so that the reader is free to choose one of the papers to start. Each paper\
    \ has its own abstract, introduction and literature."

  abstract: In this paper we determine the representation type of some algebras of
    infinite matrices continuously controlled at infinity by a compact metrizable
    space. We explicitly classify their finitely presented modules in the finite and
    tame cases. The algebra of row-column-finite (or locally finite) matrices over
    an arbitrary field is one of the algebras considered in this paper, its representation
    type is shown to be finite.
